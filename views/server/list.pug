                    | RaftDedicatedServer allows you to host your Raft world on
                    |  a dedicated server or VPS, so that your computer doesn't

                    h5.mb-3: i What are the requirements?
                    | To host a dedicated server, you need an additional copy of
                    |  Raft on Steam. You will also need a dedicated server or
                    |  VPS running Windows.

                    | Server mods (plugins) support will be added in another
                    |  release further down the road. We will have to focus on
                    |  the stability of the server first.
