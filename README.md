  - mod authors add mod updates along with changelogs.
  - old mod versions and their changelogs are kept on a mod's versions page
  - uploaded mods are automatically scanned using [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/).

The website is backed by
* a custom user system which is protected by [reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/v3.html#).

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration
Create a `database.json` file at the root of this project. An example can be found in the `database.example.json` file.
All entries in the configuration are required for the application to work properly. Here's an overview over the properties:

| property name     | what it does |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| `host`            | The postgres database host address. |
| `port`            | The postgres database's port. |
| `database`        | The postgres database name to be used by this application. |
| `user`            | The postgres database user to be used by this application. |
| `password`        | The password for the above specified postgres database user. |
| `virusTotalKey`   | The secret key used for authenticating with the VirusTotal API. |

## Initial Database data
After setting up your Configuration properly run these scripts on your database:
```sql
INSERT INTO users(id, username, email, password, "createdAt", "updatedAt")VALUES (0, 'admin', 'admin-0000000000000000000', '$2a$04$2JkewxGRqEZhSDhN4p.Xgu/vsy3vWWDdpRzFKgxUwCylpBnFgMvzS', '2019-01-01 00:00:00.000000', '2019-01-01 00:00:00.000000');
INSERT INTO "raft-versions"(id, version, "buildId", title, "releasedAt", "createdAt", "updatedAt")VALUES (0, '0.0.1', 1, 'Version 0.0.1', '2019-01-01 00:00:00.000000', '2019-01-01 00:00:00.000000', '2019-01-01 00:00:00.000000');
INSERT INTO "launcher-versions"(version, timestamp, "downloadUrl", "downloadCount", changelog, "createdAt", "updatedAt")VALUES ('0.0.1', '2019-01-01 00:00:00.000000', '', 0, '', '2019-01-01 00:00:00.000000', '2019-01-01 00:00:00.000000');
```

You can then login with `admin:admin`
