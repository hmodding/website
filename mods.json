(+20FPS on my PC)\n * Disable Raft Collisions - Disable the raft collisions, This will save a lot of performance but your raft will not collide anymore with islands. (+35FPS on my bigger raft.)\n * Disable Block Breaking Lag - When destroying a block it won't check if all the raft blocks are stable. (-5seconds of freezing on my PC)\n * Enable Poopy Quality - This will fully shittify the game. It will be worse than minecraft. (+95fps on my pc (From EXTREME to this))\n## Screenshots\n![image of the menu](https://i.imgur.com/opdmCq3.jpg)\n\n![image of the reduced graphics quality](https://i.imgur.com/Pbov6Ak.jpg)\n## Download\n[BetterFPS.dll](https://www.raftmodding.com/TeKGameRMods/BetterFPS.dll)","category":"Optimization","version":"1.1","author":"TeKGameR950"},{"id":"ItemSpawner","title":"Item Spawner","description":"Spawn any items/objects with a sexy UI","readme":"![](https://i.imgur.com/vIGFNnd.jpg)\n## How to use it?\n * To open the menu press F8\n * To give yourself an item, click on a item and click GIVE.\n * You can press the + and - button to change the amount to give, you can also edit the amount as its a textfield.\n## Screenshots?\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1KYfArc.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aLHj8Da.png)\n## Download\n[ItemSpawner.dll](https://www.raftmodding.com/forum/download/file.php?id=118)","category":"Utility","version":"2.0.1","author":"TeKGameR950"},{"id":"SimpleWeatherChange","title":"SimpleWeatherChange","description":"It allows you to change the weather...","readme":"There is not much to say about this one, other than it probably being smallest mod possible.
